Loops:

=> Loops are structures of repetition..used when we need to repeat same block of code over and over again multiple times.

Syntax:

for(initialization; condition; increment/decrement){
    // code 
}

Here if the condition is true, the code in the loop executes..If it is false, it comes out of the loop..

for(let i=0; i<=10; i++){
    console.log(i);
}

UseCases:
Iterate through an array

For in loop:

Syntax:

for(let index in arrayName){
    console.log(arrayName[index])
}

for(let index in animals){
    console.log(animals[index]);
}

The for in loop is specifically used for array elements and objects. We don't have to worry about length of array or the no of properties in an object..
    If we loop through an array, the index will be the arrayIndexes, if it is through object then the indexes will be the properties.
