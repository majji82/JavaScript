We know about DOM and we can interact with the HTML elements by using DOM..

For ex:
 <h1 id="greeting">Good Morning!</h1>

We have this element and we know that ID's are unique in HTML..So we can select the content in this id by using:
    document.getElementById("greeting").innerHTML
We can change the content inside by using 
    document.getElementById("greeting").innerHTML = "Hello World"

More select methods:

=> getElementById 
=> getElementsByClassName
=> getElementsByTagName etc.,

If we know the exact CSS selector to be selected then we can also use querySelector method.
document.querySelector("CSS-selector")
Ex: document.querySelector("p#weather")
