What is DOM?

- DOM stands for Document Object Model.
    Every time we load the page, the browser will create a JS Object, that will contain the Document Object model. This is an object that contains all the HTML elements of that page. We can interact with the HTML elements using JS with the help of DOM..

This DOM can be represented by using DOM tree..where the starting point is the document which is the parent of html and the children of html are the head and body and rest of the elements are arranged as the children and further generations of them. 

This representation of all the HTML elements as a tree [DOM tree] is Document Object Model..

=> In DOM tree, the HTML elements are called nodes.
=> We can interact with the HTML elements of our page is by calling the DOM..
