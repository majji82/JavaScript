We can also manipulate/change the CSS by using JavaScript.

Ex: We can use the same querySelector but instead of innerHTML we can select style.
document.querySelector("p#weather").style.color = "red";

Note: 
    A point to be remembered is that some of the CSS properties may contain hyphen "-". Ex: background-color, max-width etc., They cannot be directly selected. Instead we remove the hyphen and Capitalize the next letter.

    Ex: background-color is written as backgroundColor

Adding and Removing Classes:

    To add and remove classes to selected elements we have in-built methods like classList.add, classList.remove and classList.toggle [If we choose toggle, if we have the class it will remove and if we donot have it will add]
