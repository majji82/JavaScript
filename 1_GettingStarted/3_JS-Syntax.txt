Syntax:

Why do alert have parenthesis?
=>  alert('alert message') have parenthesis because alert is a function call. The functions in JS are blocks of code which we can create and give the function a name so that we can execute them later in our project..
    JS have some built-in functions like the alert function. We can also create our own functions.

=> Function names must be unique..  i.e., if a name is once used it cannot be used multiple times in the same project 
=> And also functionNames must not be reserved keyWords/ inbuilt function Names.

Curly braces in JS:

{}
The curly braces in the Javascript function is a block of code which is executed every time we invoke that function/ call the function.

Syntax of JS function:

function in JS generally have a function keyword followed by the name of the function along with (parenthesis). The arguments if any are passed in the parenthesis.
    Then we have curly braces where we place the code which has to be executed when the function is invoked.

To invoke any function we use functionName(); 
We can execute the function anywhere in the code by invoking the function wherever we need.

What are parameters in functions?

    Parameters are values which we pass it to the function to make it dynamic. Static ones are which shows the same output every time we invoke them. 
        Dynamic ones are which change according to the supplied parameters.

Another inbuilt function:

We have an object named console which has an inbuilt-function named log. Anything which is taken by the log as parameter will be displayed in the browser's console.

Ex: console.log("Hello world");

The console.log is not for the users, it is for the developers to see what is going on in the code..
