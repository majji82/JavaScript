Number DataType:

=> Some programming languages distinguish between integers and floating point numbers and will assign dataTypes like double, float etc..
    In JavaScript everything is a number including decimal point numbers.
=> With Number DataTypes we can do operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc..

let price = 17.69
console.log(typeof(price))

Ans: number

Note: If we are doing bigger operations, then watch carefully for the BODMAS rule.

=> We can also find exponents by using ** 
Ex: 2**4 is 2 power 4 which equals 16 

Math object:

=> There is an  object in JavaScript known as Math..which has many inbuilt methods that we can use with numbers.
Ex: Math.round(), Math.floor(), Math.ceil() => for rounding the numbers..

Note: If we want to round a number to a fixed number of decimal places then, use toFixed method.
price.toFixed(2) will round the number until 2 decimal places.

Conversion of DataTypes:

To convert a string to a number we can use the method parseFloat(str) or parseInt(str)
To convert a number to string we use num.toString()
