Naming Rules and best practices:

Rules:

=> Variable names may contain letters, digits, underscores (_) and dollar signs ($)
=> Names must begin with a letter, underscore or a dollar sign but "not with a number".
=> Names are case-sensitive (customer is different from Customer)
=> Reserved words (like let, const, function, if) cannot be used as variable names.

=> The most widely used pattern in JS is camelCase. Ex: customerName instead of customer_name
first word starts with lowerCase next words start with upperCase
=> variableNames must be meaningful. When we look at the code the intention of creating a variable must be easily understood.
=> Try to keep the variable name as short as possible.
