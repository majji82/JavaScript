DataTypes:

- EveryTime we assign a value to a variable it has a dataType.

Why do we need DataType?

- Operators are gonna behave differently on different variables based on their dataType.
Ex: 

let num1 = 12
let num2 = 16 
num1 + num2 = 28 (Here DataTypes of both variables are numbers)

let num1 = "12"
let num2 = "16"
num1 + num2 = "1216" (DataTypes of both are strings)

The "+" sign does addition if we supply number DataType and Concatenation if we supply String DataType..
So we have to know the dataTypes so that we don't run into unexpected results.

Note: JS is a weakly-typed language...
which means that we don't have to specifically tell the dataType while assigning and also we can re-assign the variable to a different dataType.
