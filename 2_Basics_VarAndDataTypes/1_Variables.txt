What are variables?

- Variables are names that we use to store values.
- In programming, we use some values very repeatedly in multiple locations. So instead of using the values every time, we store it in the memory and name it using a meaningful name which is called a variable.
- Another use case of variable is, if the value we use repeatedly changes, we only need to change it at the variable declaration. So redundancy will be reduced.

In Javascript to create a variable we have 3 keywords namely => let, var and const.

var customer = "Janardhan";
console.log(customer)

The problem with using var keyword is, it creates a global variable. When we have a global variable it is available anywhere within the code. It can cause conflict when we declare another variable with same name in the project elsewhere.

So to avoid the conflict we use let keyword.
Avoid using var mostly..Only use it when we need to declare the variable globally.

const keyword:
    It has the same scope of let. But if we use const we cannot reassign the value/ change the value.
    Ex: const balance = 40; balance = balance + 60; This will throw an error

=> If we want to assign a variable to global scope => var keyword
=> variable in a function scope and able to reassign => let keyword 
=> variable in a function scope and it is fixed and no reassign => use const..
