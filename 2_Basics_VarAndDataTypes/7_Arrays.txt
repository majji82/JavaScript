What is an array?

=> Array is basically a list of values.
=> Any dataType for any element inside the array is acceptable. i.e., we can have an array which contains multiple values each having a different dataType.
=> Syntax: 

let arrayName = [val1, val2, val3, ...]

Operations in arrays:

1. Finding the length of the array: arrayName.length 
2. Accessing the elements inside the array:
    The elements inside the Array can be accessed using indexes where the firstElement starts with index 0.
Ex:
    Accessing firstElement = arr[0]
    Accessing lastElement  = arr[arr.length-1]

3. Adding elements to the array at the end:
    arrayName.push(element) will push the element to the end of the Array.

4. Adding elements to the beginning of the array:
    arrayName.unshift(element) will push the element to the beginning  of the Array.

5. Merge two arrays:
    If we need to merge array1 and array2, we can do it using array1.concat(array2)

Like this we have a lot more methods..

console.log(typeof array1) => It is an Object....JS considers array as an Object.
