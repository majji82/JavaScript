Syntax:

let student = {
    studentName : "Janardhan",
    studentAge: 21,
    collegeName: "KLU"
};

Object is a set of key-value pairs for a particular Variable..

1) Accessing the values for the object:

In Objects we don't access the values using the index. Instead we access them using the keys..

1. Using the Dot Notation: 
    console.log(student.studentAge)
    console.log(student.collegeName)
2. Using the bracket Notation:
    console.log(student["collegeName"])

The key-value pairs in the object are called Properties. To access these we can use dot notation or braces notation..

2) Adding new property to object:
    student.id = "2100032153"

3) Change an existing property is similar to adding a new property. If there is no property it will be added else the value will be modified.

=> We can also have an array of Objects (Ex: students array with objects of students)
